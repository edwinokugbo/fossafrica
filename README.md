FOSSFA Website:
=================

Welcome to the Website Project of the Free Software and Open Source Foundation for Africa. This is a 'fun' project that provides basis for FOSS enthusiasts to work together on a front that promotes the growth and adoption of FOSS technologies in Africa.

Please note, that as much we are **open-source** advocates, this development repository is *private* for obvious reasons.

Steps to Contribute:
--------------------
1. Clone the repository
2. Set up a virtual environment (venv) and install required packages (`pip install -r requirements.txt`)
2. Create your local `DEVSECRET, DEVENGINE, DEVHOST, DEVDBNAME, DEVUSER,` and `DEVPASS` environment variables.
3. Create your personal development branch (do all your experiments and coding on this branch)
4. When you have something exciting, place a merge request.

Thanks for your contribution in advance.
